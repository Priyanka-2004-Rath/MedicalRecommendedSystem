# 🩺 Medical Recommended System  

## 📌 Problem  
People often experience symptoms and want quick answers about their health concerns. However, it can be difficult to differentiate between various diseases, especially when symptoms overlap. Our project provides a solution by allowing users to input symptoms and receive possible diagnoses with detailed health recommendations.

## 💡 Solution  
We developed a **Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web Application** that uses machine learning for accurate predictions.  

### 🔹 Key Features  
- **Symptom Input**: User-friendly interface to enter symptoms (supports 132 symptoms).  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained on 4,920 records using multiple algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, Naive Bayes).  
- **Best Model**: SVM achieved **100% accuracy** and was selected for final predictions.  
- **Disease Prediction**: Identifies the most likely disease from **41 different conditions**.  
- **Comprehensive Recommendations**: Provides disease description, precautions, medications, dietary advice, and workout tips.
